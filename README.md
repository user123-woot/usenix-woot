# C2_communication
This repository contains the files used to develop the C2 framework introduced in the Usinexi tool. To run the C2 framework, navigate to the "websock_c2" directory, start the c2-sniffer to launch the server, and then connect the bot to it.

It is important to ensure all required dependencies are installed beforehand, and to configure the IP addresses for both the C2 server and the bot.

# Dataset
In the "dataset" folder, we have included a portion of the dataset in CSV format, as the original dataset is too large. The original PCAP file will be uploaded to the appropriate repository once the paper is accepted.
